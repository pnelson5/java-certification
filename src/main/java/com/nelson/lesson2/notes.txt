Primitives

Eight primitives - byte, short, int, long  float, double  boolean  char

I've never performed arithmetic on char before, this actually works
how you might expect it to

    for (char i = 97; i < 123; i++) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }

bitwise complement ~a flips 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s
other bitwise operators
AND &
OR |
XOR ^

Have you ever used exclusive or a=1 ^ b=2  ? nope

I don't use switch statements, is there a best practice aroudn this? Its always smelled to me,
but hard to describe why.
