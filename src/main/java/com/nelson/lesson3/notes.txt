String init involves string internment which stores a single copy in the String Pool

StringBuilder stuff was a good refresher, don't really do that much string manipulation

Wrapper classes for primitives -

BigDecimal

java.time - LocalDate LocalTime LocalDateTime
ZonedDate

Locale ResourceBundles - I get the sense that we're doing things wrong in this space and could
really learn something here.
  Idea: a toy application that returned different text based on locale of request
