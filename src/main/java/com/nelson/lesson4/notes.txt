final keyword -
  used for declaring constants
    private final String CONSTANT = "this wont change";
  used for arguments you don't want to accidentally alter
    public String getDiscountedPrice(final BigDecimal discount)...
    ^ prevents accidentally reassigning discount


static keyword
  referred to as "class" methods or "class" variables, because
  static variables and methods are shared by all instances of that class type

  within a static method, "this" is meaningless because "this" is ambiguous

More static
  factory methods - static method that creates and returns a new instance for you.
