Inheritance

subclass superclass

everything extends Object, even if you don't see the extends it's there
Object provides toString hashCode wait etc

Polymorphism
  access modifiers can be widened but not narrowed, i.e. parent promises public access, child cannot
  narrow that to private

  @Override is optional, basically just checks that you typed it right

Abstract classes and methods
Final classes are the opposite of abtract, they can't be extended

Hashing
  Objects.hash()
  MessageDigest for secure hash

Factory Method Pattern
